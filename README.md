# CustomerChurn_Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named "Customer Churn.ipynb" that explores customer churn prediction in an e-commerce dataset, along with the same code in a .py file. The notebook covers various aspects of data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and modeling using machine learning algorithms. It includes code snippets in Python utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The analysis includes data visualization, handling missing values, outlier removal, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, it demonstrates the usage of classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayes for churn prediction. The notebook provides insights into the dataset and presents the predictive modeling process step by step.
